# SPACE INVADERSSS YAYYY!!!

## Description

This is a Space Invaders game written in python using pygame.

I took up this game to learn how to use pygame. Although there are better games to get started in and tutorials that could have helped me make it a lot better, I just wanted to give this challenge to myself.

I am aware that this has many inadequacies and can be a lot better. But I enjoyed making it a lot.

I have not yet created a build for this (if its even possible or necessary), so if you wish to run it follow the steps (I am assuming you have python installed, I will link the tutorial over here later if not)

### How to play

1. Clone this repository
2. Run the runner.py
3. Enjoy the barebones game

### Controls

- Move Player Right: D
- Move Player Left: A
- Shoot: W
- Quit Game: Q (Can also be done by clicking on the X on the top left of the Game Window)

### Disclaimer

If you have tried the above steps, you must have realized how featureful and better this version is... I'll work on it when I get more time on my hands.
